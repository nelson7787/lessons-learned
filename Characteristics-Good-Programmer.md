#**Characteristics of a good programmer**
A good programmer is:
- Always learning (i.e., attending conferences, knows about the latest books/blogs, active in the community, passionate),
- Communicates effectively (i.e., is able to explain efficiently to non developers some of the processes, able to communicate calmly when something is wrong before it starts to get out of hand, patient),
- Is realistic in his/her abilities (i.e., will not sign up for a project that he/she has no idea how to begin),
- Is versatile and flexible (i.e., can adapt to changes throughout the process - is not set in just one view of the project),
- Holds himself/herself accountable (i.e, able to admit where he/she makes mistakes and offers solutions, don't look for scapegoat, courageous),
- Documents progress periodically (i.e., provides you with weekly updates with new versions of website/app to show progress), 
- Is resilient (i.e., finish what they start), 
- Is able to keep the big picture in mind (i.e., understands how different work streams fit with the larger context)
- Designs with simplicity and scale (i.e., creativity),
- Is organized (i.e., builds a code architecture that can be understood by other programmers, good logic).
- Able to come up with reusaable functions/objects (i.e., designs systems that span multiple technologies/platforms)
- A helpful link (which is a good summary of the above):
