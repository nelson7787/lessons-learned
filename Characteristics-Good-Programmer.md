A good programmer is:
Always learning (i.e., attending conferences, knows about the latest books/blogs, active in the community),
Communicates effectively (i.e., is able to explain efficiently to non developers some of the processes),
Is realistic in his/her abilities (i.e., will not sign up for a project that he/she has no idea how to begin),
Is versatile and flexible (i.e., can adapt to changes throughout the process - is not set in just one view of the project),
Holds himself/herself accountable (i.e, able to admit where he/she makes mistakes and offers solutions),
Documents progress periodically (i.e., provides you with weekly updates with new versions of website/app to show progress),
