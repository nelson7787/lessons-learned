 Questions to ask when hiring a CTO should include:
- Tell me about yourself and your background
- Tell me about a time when you had to persevere through a tough challenge; what did you do? What ultimately happened? How did you fix the issues?
- What is your ideal company culture? How will you build out your team and keep that culture? What characteristics will you look for in developers? How will you ensure that they are good fits for the organization?
- What are your current time commitments? What hours do you see yourself working? What hours do you see your team working?
- How would you manage a team of programmers? Do you have experience doing this in the past? 
- What open source projects have you contributed to? Are you a member of any tech community?
- Have you spoken at any tech conferences? Which ones? 
- What programming languages are you fluent in? Do you have a preference? 
- Are you front-end, back-end or full-stack?
- Tell me about a product that you either built or managed the build of. What did you do at the start of every week? What did you do on the first day? On the last day? Specifically.
- What metrics have you been measured against in your previous jobs?
- Would you be comfortable coming to those to who you report with a problem in your division? What about in someone else's division?
- How would you make the product better? How would you make the user experience better? Walk me through specifics and a timeline.
- Pitch me on what this company does.
- Why do you want to work here? What brought you here?
- Do you have a blog? What do you write about?
- What are your three favorite books? One fiction, one non-fiction and the third of your choice.
- What are your compensation expectations? 
- What are your short/medium/long-term goals for this project? What do you see as the deliverables being? 
- Under what circumstances will you layoff an employee? Give me three instances where you did this and how you dealt with it? 
- Have you had to raise funds in the past? 
- Can you explain what you do to a five year old (this will see if they can communicate with non-technical people)
- What would the last CEO you worked with say about you and your work ethic? Who are they? 
- Teach me something.
