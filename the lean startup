Based on books like the lean startup or the startup owner's manual, the theory is that to start a business is very different than to scale a business.
You basically have an idea that relies on many assumptions that you build:
- Value propositions
- Key activities
- Key resources
- Customer relationships
- Channels
- Customer segments
- Key partners
- Cost srtucture
- Revenue stream

Once you have built these assumptions, you need to validate them.
It is the Build --> Measure --> Learn model

And you do it by interviewing your potential clients and as soon as possible you create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

You might need to pivot many times before finding what exact solution to offer to solve your clients' problems but this method reaaly works
