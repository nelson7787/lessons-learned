Why the lean startup approach ?
One of the critical differences is that while existing companies execute a business model, start-ups look for one. 
This distinction is at the heart of the lean start-up approach. 
It shapes the lean definition of a start-up: a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.


Based on books like the lean startup or the startup owner's manual, the theory is that to start a business is very different than to scale a business.
You basically have an idea that relies on many assumptions that you build:
- Value propositions (Underlying thesis, how the Company proposes to bring value to the customer)
- Key activities (what the business will do; the industry it operates in)
- Key resources (what will the company use in order to build its products)
- Customer relationships (how the company will engage with its customers in order to build, market and sell its product)
- Channels (what distribution and supply channels the company will utilize in order to build/sell its products)
- Customer segments (how the company will target its customers - whether it is a demographic split, or by another means)
- Key partners (who the company will engage in order to further its goals and help to build itself out)
- Cost srtucture (how the company will fund its activities and how that money will be spent)
- Revenue stream (how the company plans to generate revenue, and a breakdown of each of the different streams of revenue)

Once you have built these assumptions, you need to validate them.
It is the Build --> Measure --> Learn model

And you do it by interviewing your potential clients and as soon as possible you create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

You might need to pivot many times before finding what exact solution to offer to solve your clients' problems but this method reaaly works
Once you interviewed a good sample of your potential clients and that they agree on your assumptions, your start launching the product, even with the MVP only if necessary
