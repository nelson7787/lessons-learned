#Why the lean startup approach and how to implement it?


*One of the critical differences is that while existing companies execute a business model, start-ups look for one. 
*This distinction is at the heart of the lean start-up approach. 
**It shapes the lean definition of a start-up: a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.**


*Based on books like the lean startup or the startup owner's manual, the theory is that to start a business is very different than to scale a business.
You basically have an idea that relies on many assumptions that you build:
**1. Value propositions *(Underlying thesis, how the Company proposes to bring value to the customer)
**2. Key activities *(what the business will do; the industry it operates in)
- **3. Key resources *(what will the company use in order to build its products)
- **4. Customer relationships *(how the company will engage with its customers in order to build, market and sell its product)
- **5. Channels *(what distribution and supply channels the company will utilize in order to build/sell its products)
- **6. Customer segments *(how the company will target its customers - whether it is a demographic split, or by another means)
- **7. Key partners *(who the company will engage in order to further its goals and help to build itself out)
- **8. Cost srtucture *(how the company will fund its activities and how that money will be spent)
- **9. Revenue stream *(how the company plans to generate revenue, and a breakdown of each of the different streams of revenue)

*Once you have built these assumptions, you need to validate them.
*It is the **Build --> Measure --> Learn *model

*And you do it by interviewing your potential clients and as soon as possible you create a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

*You might need to pivot many times before finding what exact solution to offer to solve your clients' problems but this method reaaly works
*Once you interviewed a good sample of your potential clients and that they agree on your assumptions, your start launching the product, even with the MVP only if necessary*
